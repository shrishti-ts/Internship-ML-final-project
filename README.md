This project, developed during my internship at YBI Foundation, 
focuses on predicting wine quality using machine learning techniques.
Utilizing the Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, 
the project involves data analysis, preprocessing, and the application of various models like Linear Regression
